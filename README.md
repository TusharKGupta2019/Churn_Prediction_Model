In this project, I learned valuable techniques and gained hands-on experience with several libraries and models that are crucial in the field of data science while working on Churn Prediction Modeling.

Key Learnings:

Data Preprocessing: I utilized libraries like Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and analysis. I learned how to handle categorical data through Label Encoding and one-hot encoding using pd.get_dummies().

Feature Engineering: I developed new features such as Zero_Balance, Age_Group, and a ratio of balance to salary, which significantly improved model performance.

Modeling Techniques: I implemented multiple machine learning algorithms, including:
Random Forest Classifier
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Gradient Boosting Classifier

For model evaluation, I employed metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, providing a comprehensive understanding of each model's performance. The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of approximately 86.95%, showcasing its effectiveness in predicting customer churn.

Libraries Used:
pandas
numpy
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization
sklearn for machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics

This project not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of customer behavior analysis in business contexts. I'm excited to apply these insights to future projects!
